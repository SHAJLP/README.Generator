# README.Generator

DESCRIPTION

Every project requires a README, with information on the application you are working on.  This tells other developers how to use it and to make contributions if they wish.  Other developers are likely to use and help make the project succesful with an in-depth README file.

This project is a command-line application that runs NODE.js.  This quickly generates a README.md file based on inputs about your project.
